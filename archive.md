title: IntMus Version Archive
---

IntMus textbooks gradually evolve each semester in response to the unique learning process of each class. 
From 2017 through 2023 a new edition was created each year to represent that process.
In fall 2023, the IntMus Theory book reached a level of maturity and stability that we have a single current version going forward.
Older editions are preserved as a permanent reference for the course.

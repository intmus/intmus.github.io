*Integrated Musicianship: A Theory and Aural Skills Method* are open-source, interactive, online textbooks for college-level music courses written by Sean Butterfield and Miranda Wilson.
It was developed with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://open.lib.uidaho.edu/) and Evan Williamson from the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/). 

The textbook is designed to maximize flexibility and support an inquiry-based model of instruction. 
For a simple explanation of this model as well as how to best utilize this textbook's structure, please view [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html).

Integrated Musicianship makes use of [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) to present interactive musical examples throughout the text. 
Checkout the [ABC Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/abc-tutorial.html) to get started with ABC Notation. *Note: the full functionality of abcjs works best on up-to-date Chrome or Firefox browsers.*

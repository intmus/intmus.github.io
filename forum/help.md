title: IntTheory Forum Help
---

The [IntMus forums]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/index.html) are added to the sites using the [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) community platform service.
This is a public forum intended to help students learn, communicate, and collaborate around IntMus.

Get started by logging into [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) using a Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Disqus account. 
In this setting, it is often better to use a professional account to keep your academic discussion separate from your personal social media.
We suggest creating a Disqus account to avoid sharing your personal social media details.

To follow the forum discussions, scroll to the **bottom of the comments** and look for the "Subscribe" button. 
After subscribing, you should receive email notifications when people add new comments. 
Try checking your [Disqus account settings](https://disqus.com/home/settings/email/) if you are not receiving emails.
